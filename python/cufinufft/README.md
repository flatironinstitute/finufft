# cuFINUFFT v2.2 Python package

The cuFINUFFT library is an efficient GPU implementation of the 1-, 2- and
3-dimensional nonuniform fast Fourier transform (NUFFT). It includes both type
1 (nonuniform to uniform) and type 2 (uniform to nonuniform) transforms.
It is based on the [FINUFFT](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/finufft)
implementation for the CPU. This package provides a Python interface to the
cuFINUFFT library, which is written in C++ and CUDA.

For a mathematical description of the NUFFT and applications to signal
processing, imaging, and scientific computing, see [the FINUFFT
documentation](https://finufft.readthedocs.io). Usage examples can be found
[here](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/finufft/tree/master/examples/cuda).

**Note**: With version 2.2 of cuFINUFFT, we have changed the interfaces slightly to better align with FINUFFT. For an outline of the changes, please see [the migration guide](https://finufft.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cufinufft_migration.html).
