# FINUFFT GPU library Python wrappers

This is a Python interface to the efficient GPU CUDA implementation of the 1-, 2- and
3-dimensional nonuniform fast Fourier transform (NUFFT), provided
in the FINUFFT library. It performs type
1 (nonuniform to uniform) or type 2 (uniform to nonuniform) transforms.
For a mathematical description of the NUFFT and applications to signal
processing, imaging, and scientific computing, see [the FINUFFT
documentation](https://finufft.readthedocs.io).
The Python GPU interface is [here](https://finufft.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_gpu.html).
Usage examples can be found in the examples folder in the same directory as
the file you are reading.

**Note**: With version 2.2 we have changed the GPU interfaces slightly to better align with FINUFFT. For an outline of the changes, please see [the migration guide](https://finufft.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cufinufft_migration.html).
