"""The Python interface to FINUFFT is divided into two parts: the simple
interface (through the ``nufft*`` functions) and the more advanced plan
interface (through the ``Plan`` class). The former allows the user to perform
an NUFFT in a single call while the latter allows for more efficient reuse of
resources when the same NUFFT is applied several times to different data by
saving FFTW plans, sorting the nonuniform points, and so on.
