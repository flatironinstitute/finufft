/**
@page CBRNG Counter Based RNGs (CBRNGs).

The counter-based random number generators (CBRNGs)
in the Random123 library are described in more detail in
<a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2063405"><i>Parallel Random Numbers:  As Easy as 1, 2, 3</i> </a>,
which was named the Best Paper at the ACM SC'11 International Conference on High Performance Computing, Networking,
Storage, and Analysis.
All the CBRNGs in the library conform to a  consistent
interface.  Basically:
\verbatim
    value = CBRNGname(counter, key)
\endverbatim

Thus, with some care, they can be used
interchangeably in applications. (Since code
compiled with AES-NI instructions will result
in an illegal instruction exception on processors
without those instructions, Random123 provides a
@ref haveAESNI function that can be used
to detect the existence of AES at run-time;
user code could use it to either report an
error or substitute an alternative compatible
CBRNG.)

The API descriptions below are generic, but apply to
all the different @ref families "families" of 
Random123 CBRNGs.

\section arrays Fixed-size Array Types

Data is passed into and back from the Random123 functions as
@ref arrayNxW "r123arrayNxW"
types; these types
contain fixed-size arrays of W-bit types (\c uintW_t for the
most part, but also a special r123m128i wrapper for the @ref
AESNI "ARS and AESNI" CBRNGs). The counter argument
and the return value have the same type, 
referred to as \c ctr_type in C++, and \c ctr_t in C.  The
type of the key argument is referred to as \c key_type in C++,
and \c key_t in C.
For an  @ref arrayNxW "r123arrayNxW", \c r, the data member \c r.v is an array of N elements,
each of width W (each element is
type \c uintW_t or an r123m128i wrapper object).
C programs can access these elements as \c r.v[0], ... \c r.v[N-1] for
the \c uintW_t types.

In C++, these array types closely resemble the C++0x std::array<N, uintW_t> template, but do not
require C++11 libraries or compiler features. 
C++ programs can access array elements via operator[]
\c r[0], ... \c r[N-1], or via most of the capabilities
of a C++ "Container" e.g. \c at(), \c begin(), \c end(),
\c size() and others.  In addition, containers have <c> incr() </c> and <c> incr(unsigned long long)</c>
member function that do increment-with-carry, which facilitate
using r123arrays as very-long-period counters.

If the compiler environment supports it,
\c Random123/array.h also declares \c r123array1xm128i, which contains an array of one
\c r123m128i, which in turn is a class wrapping a single element
of \c __m128i SSE type, which can be accessed as \c r.v[0].m.
The @ref r123::ARS1xm128i_R RNGs
use \c r123array1xm128i for both \c ctr_type and \c key_type.
For the @ref AESNI "AESNI" RNG, \c ctr_type is an \c r123array1xm128i, but 
\c key_type is an opaque type, which must be initialized
by assignment from a <c>userkey_type</c> (an r123array1xm128i).

\section aliasing A note on aliasing and type-punning
It is easiest (though not necessarily fastest) to choose a CBRNG whose
\c ctr_type matches the width of the random data needed by the
application, e.g., Philox4x32 for applications that need random data in
32-bit words.  If the application's needs don't match the counter's value_type,
it is tempting to use "type punning" and pointer casts to interconvert between
types.  Such conversions require great care and are very difficult to do
safely without use of unions or memcpy.  
See <a
href="http://blog.worldofcoding.com/2010/02/solving-gcc-44-strict-aliasing-problems.html">
here</a>
and 
<a href="http://dbp-consulting.com/tutorials/StrictAliasing.html">
here</a>
for discussions of the pitfalls related to aliasing.
The C++
@ref r123::ReinterpretCtr template is a safe way to reinterpret \c CBRNG
counter types.
Gcc's \c
-Wstrict-aliasing=2 warning level will warn if strict aliasing
violations are detected.  If you find yourself ignoring or disabling
warnings about strict aliasing, you should strongly consider adding something
like gcc's \c -fnostrict-aliasing option to your compiler
flags.

\section cxxapi C++ API

There are four families of CBRNGs in the library:
<ul>
<li> @ref ThreefryNxW "Threefry": @ref r123::Threefry2x32, @ref r123::Threefry4x32, @ref r123::Threefry2x64, @ref r123::Threefry4x64
<li> @ref PhiloxNxW "Philox": @ref r123::Philox2x32, @ref r123::Philox4x32, @ref r123::Philox2x64, @ref r123::Philox4x64
<li> @ref r123::AESNI4x32, r123::AESNI1xm128i
<li> @ref r123::ARS4x32_R
</ul>

A <i> counter based RNG </i> (CBRNG) with a name of the form
<i>FamilynameN</i>x<i>W</i> is a type G
with the three member typedefs:

<ul>
<li> G::ctr_type, which is an @ref arrayNxW "r123arrayNxW" container class.
<li> G::ukey_type, which is an @ref arrayNxW "r123arrayMxV" container class.
Note that the width, \c MxV of the key
may not be the same as the width \c NxW of
the ctr_type (@ref PhiloxNxW "Philox" keys are half as wide as the counter,
and future CBRNGs may well have different widths).
<li> G::key_type, which in most cases is identical to
G::ukey_type, but is different for the @ref AESNI "AESNI" types.
In all cases, there is a G::key_type(G::ukey_type) constructor
and a G::key_type assignment operator for a G::ukey_type
right-hand-side.  In general, one can always write:
@code
  G::ukey_type uk1, uk2;
  // user code initializes uk1 and uk2
  G::key_type  k1(uk1), k2;
  k2 = uk2;
@endcode
</ul>
For most CBRNG's, i.e., any one not in the @ref AESNI "AESNI" family, it is also
perfectly acceptable to set the elements of a G::key_type directly from application variables.
The quality of the results will not be compromised by using highly correlated
or "non-random" keys.

A value \c g of type \c G can be invoked as <c>g(c,k)</c>, where \c c
is a value of type \c G::ctr_type and \c k is a value of type \c G::key_type,
and <c>g(c,k)</c> returns a value of type \c G::ctr_type.

<ul>
<li> g() is a stateless, pure function.  That is, g(c,k) may be called
any number of times in any context and always returns the same result
for the same inputs.  In particular, c1==c2 and k1==k2 implies that g(c1,k1)
== g(c2,k2).  
<li> For constant k, g(*,k) is a bijection.  That is, 
g(c1,k) == g(c2,k) if and only if c1 == c2.
<li> g "randomizes" its inputs.  That is,
for most sequences of inputs (c1,k1),
(c2, k2), ...  (including those obtained by following highly
regular patterns of incrementing and striding 
through the counter and user key spaces) the output sequence, g(c1, k1),
g(c2, k2), ...  looks like a a sequence of uniformly distributed
random variables drawn from the set of all ctr_types.
</ul>

All the CBRNGs in the library work by iterating a randomization function for a specific number of \e rounds.
Too few rounds and the CBRNG is a poor (perhaps
catastrophically poor) random number generator.  Too many rounds and time is wasted
with little or no improvement in the randomness of the output.  Each of the CBRNGs
has a specific number of rounds which the authors believe is a reasonable compromise
between speed and quality.  In all cases, the default number of rounds includes a margin
of safety above the minimum number of rounds that have passed all of the SmallCrush, Crush and BigCrush 
tests in the <a href="http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~simardr/testu01/tu01.html"> TestU01</a> suite.

Users may, however wish to employ a different numbers of rounds.  Each of the above
classes is actually a typedef of a more general class with a template parameter that
specifies the number of rounds as <i>name</i>_rounds.  The template classes all end in \c _R:

<ul>
<li> @ref ThreefryNxW "Threefry": @ref r123::Threefry2x32_R, @ref r123::Threefry4x32_R, @ref r123::Threefry2x64_R, @ref r123::Threefry4x64_R
<li> @ref PhiloxNxW "Philox": @ref r123::Philox2x32_R, @ref r123::Philox4x32_R, @ref r123::Philox2x64_R, @ref r123::Philox4x64_R
<li> @ref r123::AESNI4x32_R, r123::AESNI1xm128i_R
<li> @ref r123::ARS4x32_R
</ul>

\section capi C API

A subset of the C++ interface
is also directly usable by C programs.  All header files may be
safely included in C files.  The C API to each of the
supported RNGs consists of two typedefs, <i>name</i>_ctr_t,
<i>name</i>_key_t, two functions <i>name</i>() and <i>name</i>_R(), and
the enum <i>name</i>_rounds which specifies the recommended number of rounds.
<ul>
<li> <i>name</i>(c, k), performs the recommended number of rounds of the <i>name</i> CBRNG.
<li> <i>name_R</i>(R,c,k), performs an R-round version of the <i>name</i> CBRNG.
<i>name</i>(c,k) is equivalent to
<i>name</i>_R(<i>name</i>_rounds, c, k).
</ul>

The \c _R functions are designed and implemented so that an optimizing compiler can achieve good performance
when the number of rounds is a compile-time constant.  It is likely that <c>philox4x32_R(10,c,k) </c>
will perform much better than <c>philox4x32_R(r,c,k)</c> if \c r cannot be
evaluated at compile-time.

The supported names for the C API are
<ul>
<li> @ref ThreefryNxW "threefry": @ref threefry2x32, @ref threefry4x32, @ref threefry2x64, @ref threefry4x64.
<li> @ref PhiloxNxW "philox": @ref philox2x32, @ref philox4x32, @ref philox2x64, @ref philox4x64.
<li> @ref ars4x32_R, @ref ars1xm128i_R
<li> @ref aesni4x32, @ref aesni1xm128i
</ul>
