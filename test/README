Testing (validation not performance) directory for FINUFFT.

All source codes in here are dual precision (ie, depending on the -DSINGLE
compilation flag presence, they build double or single precision and link
against the appropriate FINUFFT library functions).

For a fixed number of threads (the make task fixes OMP_NUM_THREADS=4), the
OpenMP static scheduling for rand-# generation means that the test data should
be reproducible (non-stochastic). Reordering of thread ops in FINUFFT itself
leads to rounding-error variations only.

up to reordering

basicpassfail{f} : basic double and single-prec smoke tests
                   (exit code 0 is a pass).
check_finufft.sh : validates the FINUFFT library for correctness
                   (exit code 0 is a pass). See docs in that script.
results/*.out : outputs written by check_finufft.sh, for the record.

Possibly obsolete scripts (for developers):
checkallaccs.sh : spreading and NUFFT at all #s of digits, for a single ndims
