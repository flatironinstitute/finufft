# Makefile variable overrides for Mac OSX compilation with CLANG.

# Note that we have not been able to link against gfortran, so if you need
# fortran interfaces, use make.inc.macosx_gcc-* instead.
#
# Copy this file to make.inc, and if needed edit for your setup.

#    ld: warning: object file (lib-static/libfinufft.a(finufft1d.o)) was built for
#    newer OSX version (10.13) than being linked (10.9)
# Then you can uncomment the following two lines with the older version number

# MATLAB interface: this will probably segfault. Instead we suggest you use
# make.inc.macosx_clang_matlab

# Some of these will depend on your FFTW library location...
# (ld_classic avoids the new XCode apple linker, as of Feb 2026)
