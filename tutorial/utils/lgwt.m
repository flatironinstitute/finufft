function [x,w]=lgwt(N,a,b)
% lgwt.m
%
% This script is for computing definite integrals using Legendre-Gauss
% Quadrature. Computes the Legendre-Gauss nodes and weights  on an interval
% [a,b] with truncation order N
%
% Suppose you have a continuous function f(x) which is defined on [a,b]
% which you can evaluate at any x in [a,b]. Simply evaluate it at all of
% the values contained in the x vector to obtain a vector f. Then compute
% the definite integral using sum(f.*w);
