* GPU type 3   Marco?

* implement Reinecke's sparse sliced FFT, w/ many-vectors too. CPU
Libin help?

* CPU perf tests, standardized way to benchmark spread/interp, FFT, H<>D, etc.
Add to docs/devnotes.rst how to run benchmarks.
Robert + Joakim

* tutorial in docs: on eg inverse FFT by CG iteration.

* doc for py local install #340

* #340 docs for GPU simple interface
