MATLAB/octave interfaces to FINUFFT.

See Contents.m for a list of commands available.
See comments headers in *.m for usage of each command.
See ../docs/matlab.rst for local human-readable help

Notes for maintainers on management of this directory
-----------------------------------------------------

For ease of maintainance we use a single source of truth as much as possible,
thus some files are generated by others.


* MEX interfaces:

From the source finufft.mw, the files finufft.ccp and finufft_plan.m
are auto-generated by MWrap (see ../makefile: make mex). This need not
be run by typical users, since the latter two are part of the git
repo. A recent version of MWrap must be used.
See: https://github.com/zgimbutas/mwrap

The simple interfaces finufft?d?.m are short wrappers to the
finufft_plan.m object methods.


* Documentation generation:

The source of MATLAB documentation is *.docsrc, which are matlab comment
blocks, plus tokens indicating insertion of the repeated text blocks *.docbit.
This is a simple custom format.
To generate the docs, and prepend them to all the f*.m files, run:
  ./addmhelp.sh
in which the list of tokens is defined.
Note that the f*.m files should have no % comment block after the function
definitions; the script adds the help comments at the start of each m-file.

Once *.m contains the updated help comments, and you have edited Contents.m
by hand (it is not auto-generated), one should then run
  ../docs/genmatlabhelp.sh
to update .rst web doc source.
