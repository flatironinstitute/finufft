% CUFINUFFT1D2   GPU 1D complex nonuniform FFT, type 2 (uniform to nonuniform).
%
% c = cufinufft1d2(x,isign,eps,f)
% c = cufinufft1d2(x,isign,eps,f,opts)
%
% This computes on the GPU, to relative precision eps, via a fast algorithm:
%
%    c[j] = SUM   f[k1] exp(+/-i k1 x[j])      for j = 1,...,nj
%            k1
%     where sum is over -ms/2 <= k1 <= (ms-1)/2.
%
%  Inputs:
%     x     length-nj vector of real-valued locations of nonuniform sources
%     f     complex Fourier coefficients. If a vector, length sets ms
%           (with mode ordering given by opts.modeord). If a matrix, each
%           of ntrans columns is transformed with the same nonuniform targets.

%  Outputs:
%     c     complex column vector of nj answers at targets, or,
%           if ntrans>1, matrix of size (nj,ntrans).
