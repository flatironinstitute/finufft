% Notes:
%  * The vectorized (many vector) interface, ie ntrans>1, can be much faster
%    than repeated calls with the same nonuniform points. Note that here the I/O
%    data ordering is stacked rather than interleaved. See ../docs/matlab.rst
%  * The class of input x (double vs single) controls whether the double or
%    single precision library are called; precisions of all data should match.
%  * For more details about the opts fields, see ../docs/opts.rst
%  * See ERRHANDLER, VALID_* and FINUFFT_PLAN for possible warning/error IDs.
%  * Full documentation is online at http://finufft.readthedocs.io
