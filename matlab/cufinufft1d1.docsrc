% CUFINUFFT1D1   GPU 1D complex nonuniform FFT, type 1 (nonuniform to uniform).
%
% f = cufinufft1d1(x,c,isign,eps,ms)
% f = cufinufft1d1(x,c,isign,eps,ms,opts)
%
% This computes on the GPU, to relative precision eps, via a fast algorithm:
%
%               nj
%     f(k1) =  SUM c[j] exp(+/-i k1 x(j))  for -ms/2 <= k1 <= (ms-1)/2
%              j=1
%   Inputs:
%     x     length-nj vector of real-valued locations of nonuniform sources
%     c     length-nj complex vector of source strengths. If numel(c)>nj,
%           expects a stack of vectors (eg, a nj*ntrans matrix) each of which is
%           transformed with the same source locations.
ISIGNEPS
%     ms    number of Fourier modes computed, may be even or odd;
%           in either case, mode range is integers lying in [-ms/2, (ms-1)/2]
GOPTS
GOPTS12
%   Outputs:
%     f     size-ms complex column vector of Fourier coefficients, or, if
%           ntrans>1, a matrix of size (ms,ntrans).
