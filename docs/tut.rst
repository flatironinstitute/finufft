Tutorials and application demos
==================================

The following are instructive demos of using FINUFFT for a variety of
spectrally-related tasks arising in
scientific computing and signal/image processing. We will slowly grow the
list (contact us to add one).
For conciseness of code, and ease of writing, they are currently
in MATLAB (they should work on versions at least back to R2017a).
