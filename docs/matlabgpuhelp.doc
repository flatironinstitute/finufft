           if ntrans>1, matrix of size (nj,ntrans).

 Notes:
  * For CUFINUFFT all array I/O is in the form of gpuArrays (on-device).
  * The precision of gpuArray input x controls whether the double or
    single precision GPU library is called; all array inputs must match in
    location (ie, be gpuArrays), and in precision.
  * The vectorized (many vector) interface, ie ntrans>1, can be faster
    than repeated calls with the same nonuniform points. Note that here the
    I/O data ordering is stacked not interleaved. See ../docs/matlab_gpu.rst

 CUFINUFFT3D3   GPU 3D complex nonuniform FFT, type 3 (nonuniform to nonuniform).

 f = cufinufft3d3(x,y,z,c,isign,eps,s,t,u)
 f = cufinufft3d3(x,y,z,c,isign,eps,s,t,u,opts)

 This computes on the GPU, to relative precision eps, via a fast algorithm:

              nj
     f[k]  =  SUM   c[j] exp(+-i (s[k] x[j] + t[k] y[j] + u[k] z[j])),
              j=1
                              for k = 1, ..., nk
   Inputs:
     x,y,z  coordinates of nonuniform sources in R^3, each a length-nj vector.
     c     length-nj complex vector of source strengths. If numel(c)>nj,
           expects a stack of vectors (eg, a nj*ntrans matrix) each of which is
           transformed with the same source and target locations.
     isign if >=0, uses + sign in exponential, otherwise - sign.
     eps   relative precision requested (generally between 1e-15 and 1e-1)
     s,t,u  frequency coordinates of nonuniform targets in R^3,
           each a length-nk vector.
     opts   optional struct with optional fields controlling the following:
     opts.debug:   0 (silent, default), 1 (timing breakdown), 2 (debug info).
     opts.upsampfac:   sigma.  2.0 (default), or 1.25 (low RAM, smaller FFT).
     opts.gpu_method:  0 (auto, default), 1 (GM or GM-sort), 2 (SM).
     opts.gpu_sort:  0 (do not sort NU pts), 1 (sort when GM method, default).
     opts.gpu_kerevalmeth:  0 (slow reference). 1 (Horner ppoly, default).
     opts.gpu_maxsubprobsize:  max # NU pts per subprob (gpu_method=2 only).
     opts.gpu_binsize{x,y,z}:  various binsizes in GM-sort/SM (for experts).
     opts.gpu_maxbatchsize:   0 (auto, default), or many-vector batch size.
     opts.gpu_device_id:  sets the GPU device ID (experts only).
   Outputs:
     f     length-nk complex vector of values at targets, or, if ntrans>1,
           a matrix of size (nk,ntrans)

::

 CUFINUFFT_PLAN   is a class which wraps the guru GPU interface to FINUFFT.

  Full documentation is online at http://finufft.readthedocs.io
  Also see examples in matlab/cuda/examples and matlab/cuda/test

 PROPERTIES
   mwptr - opaque pointer to a C++ finufft_plan object (see MWrap manual),
           whose properties cannot be accessed directly
   floatprec - either 'double' or 'single', tracks what precision of C++
           library is being called
   type, dim, n_modes, n_trans, nj, nk, xj, yj, zj - other plan parameters.
  Note: the user should never alter these plan properties directly! Rather,
  the below methods should be used to create, use, and destroy plans.

 METHODS
   cufinufft_plan - create plan object for one/many general nonuniform FFTs.
   setpts       - process nonuniform points for general FINUFFT transform(s).
   execute      - execute single or many-vector FINUFFT transforms in a plan.

 General notes:
  * All array inputs and outputs are MATLAB gpuArrays of the same precision.
  * Use delete(plan) to remove a plan after use.
  * See ERRHANDLER, VALID_*, and this code for warning/error IDs.



 =========== Detailed description of guru methods ==========================

 1) CUFINUFFT_PLAN create plan object for one/many general nonuniform FFTs.

 plan = cufinufft_plan(type, n_modes_or_dim, isign, ntrans, eps)
 plan = cufinufft_plan(type, n_modes_or_dim, isign, ntrans, eps, opts)

 Creates a cufinufft_plan MATLAB object in the interface to GPU FINUFFT, of
  type 1, 2 or 3, and with given numbers of Fourier modes (unless type 3).

 Inputs:
     type            transform type: 1, 2, or 3
     n_modes_or_dim  if type is 1 or 2, the number of Fourier modes in each
                     dimension: [ms] in 1D, [ms mt] in 2D, or [ms mt mu] in 3D.
                     Its length sets the dimension, which must be 1, 2 or 3.
                     If type is 3, in contrast, its *value* fixes the dimension
     isign if >=0, uses + sign in exponential, otherwise - sign.
     eps   relative precision requested (generally between 1e-15 and 1e-1)
     opts   optional struct with optional fields controlling the following:
     opts.debug:   0 (silent, default), 1 (timing breakdown), 2 (debug info).
     opts.upsampfac:   sigma.  2.0 (default), or 1.25 (low RAM, smaller FFT).
     opts.gpu_method:  0 (auto, default), 1 (GM or GM-sort), 2 (SM).
     opts.gpu_sort:  0 (do not sort NU pts), 1 (sort when GM method, default).
     opts.gpu_kerevalmeth:  0 (slow reference). 1 (Horner ppoly, default).
     opts.gpu_maxsubprobsize:  max # NU pts per subprob (gpu_method=2 only).
     opts.gpu_binsize{x,y,z}:  various binsizes in GM-sort/SM (for experts).
     opts.gpu_maxbatchsize:   0 (auto, default), or many-vector batch size.
     opts.gpu_device_id:  sets the GPU device ID (experts only).
     opts.floatprec: library precision to use, 'double' (default) or 'single'.
     for type 1 and 2 only, the following opts fields are also relevant:
     opts.modeord: 0 (CMCL increasing mode ordering, default), 1 (FFT ordering)
     opts.gpu_spreadinterponly: 0 (do NUFFT, default), 1 (only spread/interp)
 Outputs:
     plan            cufinufft_plan object (opaque pointer)

 Notes:
  * For type 1 and 2, this does the cuFFT planning and kernel-FT precompute.
  * For type 3, this does very little, since cuFFT sizes are not yet known.
  * The vectorized (many vector) plan, ie ntrans>1, can be faster
    than repeated calls with the same nonuniform points. Note that here the
    I/O data ordering is stacked not interleaved. See ../docs/matlab_gpu.rst
  * For more details about the opts fields, see ../docs/c_gpu.rst


 2) SETPTS   process nonuniform points for general GPU FINUFFT transform(s).

 plan.setpts(xj)
 plan.setpts(xj, yj)
 plan.setpts(xj, yj, zj)
 plan.setpts(xj, [], [], s)
 plan.setpts(xj, yj, [], s, t)
 plan.setpts(xj, yj, zj, s, t, u)

  When plan is a cufinufft_plan MATLAB object, brings in nonuniform point
  coordinates (xj,yj,zj), and additionally in the type 3 case, nonuniform
  frequency target points (s,t,u). Empty arrays may be passed in the case of
  unused dimensions. For all types, sorting is done to internally store a
  reindexing of points, and for type 3 the spreading and FFTs are planned.
  The nonuniform points may be used for multiple transforms.

 Inputs:
     xj     vector of x-coords of all nonuniform points
     yj     empty (if dim<2), or vector of y-coords of all nonuniform points
     zj     empty (if dim<3), or vector of z-coords of all nonuniform points
     s      vector of x-coords of all nonuniform frequency targets
     t      empty (if dim<2), or vector of y-coords of all frequency targets
     u      empty (if dim<3), or vector of z-coords of all frequency targets
 Input/Outputs:
     plan   cufinufft_plan object

 Notes:
  * The values in xj (and if nonempty, yj and zj) are real-valued, and
    invariant under translations by multiples of 2pi. For type 1
    they are "sources", whereas for type 2 they are "targets".
    For type 3 there is no periodicity, and no restrictions other
    than the resulting size of the internal fine grids.
  * s (and t and u) are only relevant for type 3, and may be omitted otherwise
  * The matlab vectors xj,... and s,... should not be changed before calling
    future execute calls, because the plan stores only pointers to the
    arrays (they are not duplicated internally).
  * The precision (double/single) of all inputs must match that chosen at the
    plan stage using opts.floatprec, otherwise an error is raised.


 3) EXECUTE   execute single or many-vector GPU FINUFFT transforms in a plan.

 result = plan.execute(data_in);

  For plan a previously created cufinufft_plan object also containing all
  needed nonuniform point coordinates, do a single (or if ntrans>1 in the
  plan stage, multiple) NUFFT transform(s), with the strengths or Fourier
  coefficient inputs vector(s) from data_in. The result of the transform(s)
  is returned as a (possibly multidimensional) gpuArray.

 Inputs:
     plan     cufinufft_plan object
     data_in  strengths (types 1 or 3) or Fourier coefficients (type 2)
              vector, matrix, or array of appropriate size. For type 1 and 3,
              this is either a length-M vector (where M is the length of xj),
              or an (M,ntrans) matrix when ntrans>1. For type 2, in 1D this is
              length-ms, in 2D size (ms,mt), or in 3D size (ms,mt,mu), or
              each of these with an extra last dimension ntrans if ntrans>1.
 Outputs:
     result   vector of output strengths at targets (types 2 or 3), or array
              of Fourier coefficients (type 1), or, if ntrans>1, a stack of
              such vectors or arrays, of appropriate size.
              Specifically, if ntrans=1, for type 1, in 1D
              this is a length-ms column vector, in 2D a matrix of size
              (ms,mt), or in 3D an array of size (ms,mt,mu); for types 2 and 3
              it is a column vector of length M (the length of xj in type 2),
              or nk (the length of s in type 3). If ntrans>1 its is a stack
              of such objects, ie, it has an extra last dimension ntrans.

 Notes:
  * The precision (double/single) of all gpuArrays must match that chosen at
    the plan stage using opts.floatprec, otherwise an error is raised.


 4) To deallocate (delete) a GPU nonuniform FFT plan, use delete(plan)

 This deallocates all stored cuFFT plans, nonuniform point sorting arrays,
  kernel Fourier transforms arrays, etc.
