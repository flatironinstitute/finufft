Dependent packages, wrappers, users, and citations
==================================================

Here we list packages that depend on or wrap FINUFFT, and papers or groups using it.
Papers that merely cite our work are listed separately at the bottom. Please let us know (and use github's dependent package link) if you are a user or package maintainer but not listed, and please "star" our GitHub repo.
It will help us to improve the library if you also
describe your use case parameters
`here <https://github.com/flatironinstitute/finufft/discussions/398>`_.


Packages relying on FINUFFT or cuFINUFFT
----------------------------------------

Here are some packages dependent on FINUFFT (please let us know of others,
and also add them to GitHub's Used By feature):

1. `SMILI <https://github.com/astrosmili/smili>`_, very long baseline interferometry reconstruction code by `Kazu Akiyama <http://kazuakiyama.github.io/>`_ and others, uses FINUFFT (2d1, 2d2, Fortran interfaces) as a `key library <https://smili.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#external-libraries>`_. Akiyama used SMILI to reconstruct the `famous black hole image <https://physicstoday.scitation.org/do/10.1063/PT.6.1.20190411a/full/>`_ in 2019 from the Event Horizon Telescope.

Papers influenced by other aspects of FINUFFT:

1. NFFT.jl: Generic and Fast Julia Implementation of the Nonequidistant Fast Fourier Transform, by Tobias Knopp, Marija Boberg, Mirco Grosser (2022). https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00049  They use our blocked spreading and piecewise polynomial ideas, and beat our type 1 and 2 performance by a factor of up to 1.7 in multithreaded cases. Code is dimension-independent but very abstract (two levels of meta-programming, I believe).
