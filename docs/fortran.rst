Usage from Fortran
==========================

We provide Fortran interfaces that are very similar to those in C/C++.
We deliberately use "legacy" Fortran style (in the `terminology
of FFTW <http://www.fftw.org/fftw3_doc/Calling-FFTW-from-Legacy-Fortran.html>`_), enabling the widest applicability and avoiding the complexity of
later Fortran features.
Namely, we use f77, with two features from f90: dynamic allocation
and derived types. The latter is only needed if options must be
changed from default values.
We also include, listed at the bottom below, a "modern" f90 demo using a module.

Quick-start example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To perform a double-precision 1D type 1 transform from ``M`` nonuniform points ``xj``
with strengths ``cj``, to ``N`` output modes whose coefficients will be written
into the ``fk`` array, using 9-digit tolerance, the $+i$ imaginary sign,
and default options, the declarations and call are

.. code-block:: fortran

      integer ier,iflag
      integer*8 N,M
      real*8, allocatable :: xj(:)
      real*8 tol
      complex*16, allocatable :: cj(:),fk(:)
      integer*8, allocatable :: null

 !    (...allocate xj, cj, and fk, and fill xj and cj here...)

      tol = 1.0D-9
      iflag = +1
      call finufft1d1(M,xj,cj,iflag,tol,N,fk,null,ier)

which writes the output to ``fk``, and the status to the integer ``ier``.
Since the default is CMCL mode ordering, the output for frequency index ``k``
is found in ``fk(k+N/2+1)``.
``ier=0`` indicates success, otherwise error codes are
as in :ref:`here <error>`.
All available OMP threads are used, unless FINUFFT was built single-threaded.
(Note that here the unallocated ``null`` is simply a way to pass
a NULL pointer to our C++ wrapper; another would be ``%val(0_8)``.)
For a minimally complete test code demonstrating the above see
``fortran/examples/simple1d1.f``.

.. note::

   Higher-dimensional arrays are stored in Fortran ordering
   with $x$ (``N1``) the fastest direction, and, in the vectorized
   ("many") calls, the transform number is slowest (transforms are
   stacked not interleaved).
   For instance, for the 2D type 1 vectorized transform
   ``finufft2d1many(ntrans,M,xj,yj,cj,iflag,tol,N1,N2,fk,opts,ier)``
   with CMCL mode-ordering,
   the ``(k1,k2)`` frequency coefficient from transform number ``t`` is
   to be found at ``fk(k1+N1/2+1 + (k2+N2/2)*N1 + t*N1*N2)``.

From the ``fortran/examples/`` directory, to
compile (eg using GCC/linux) and link such a program against the FINUFFT
static library, one must list dependent libraries by hand::

  gfortran -I../../include simple1d1.f -o simple1d1 ../../lib-static/libfinufft.a -lfftw3 -lfftw3_omp -lgomp -lstdc++

Then to execute run ``./simple1d1``. Alternatively, a smaller executable results by
linking against the dynamic (``.so``) library (which links all dependent libraries)::

  gfortran -I../../include simple1d1.f -o simple1d1 -L../../lib -Wl,-rpath=$FINUFFT/lib -lfinufft

where ``$FINUFFT`` must be replaced by (or be an environment variable set to) the absolute install path for this repository.
Note the use of ``rpath`` to make an executable that may be run from, or moved to, any directory.
Alternatively you may want to compile with ``g++`` and use ``-lgfortran`` at the end of the compile statement instead of ``-lstdc++``.
In Mac OSX, replace ``fftw3_omp`` by ``fftw3_threads``, and if you use
clang, ``-lgomp`` by ``-lomp``. See ``makefile`` and ``make-platforms/*``.

.. note ::
 Our simple interface is designed to be a near drop-in replacement for the native f90 `CMCL libraries of Greengard-Lee <http://www.cims.nyu.edu/cmcl/nufft/nufft.html>`_. The differences are: i) we added a penultimate argument in the list which allows options to be changed, and ii) our normalization differs for type 1 transforms (divide FINUFFT output by $M$ to match CMCL output).

Changing options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To choose non-default options in the above example, create an options
derived type, set it to default values, change whichever you wish, and pass
it to FINUFFT, for instance

.. code-block:: fortran

      include 'finufft.fh'
      type(finufft_opts) opts

 !    (...declare, allocate, and fill stuff as above...)

      call finufft_default_opts(opts)
      opts%debug = 2
      opts%upsampfac = 1.25d0
      call finufft1d1(M,xj,cj,iflag,tol,N,fk,opts,ier)

See ``fortran/examples/simple1d1.f`` for the complete code,
and below for the complete list of Fortran subroutines available,
and more complicated examples.

See ``modeord`` in :ref:`Options<opts>`
to instead use FFT-style mode ordering, which
simply differs by an ``fftshift`` (as it is commonly called).


Summary of Fortran interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The names of routines and the meanings of all arguments is identical
to the :ref:`C/C++ routines <c>`.
Eg, ``finufft2d3`` means double-precision 2D transform of type 3.
``finufft2d3many`` means applying double-precision
2D transforms of type 3 to a stack of many
strength vectors (vectorized interface).
``finufft2d3f`` means single-precision 2D type 3.
The guru interface has very similar arguments to its C/C++ version.
Compared to C/C++, all argument lists have ``ier`` appended at the end,
to which the status is written; this is the same as the return value
in the C/C++ interfaces.
These routines and arguments are, in double-precision:

.. code-block:: fortran

      include 'finufft.fh'
 !    (or in F90 one may instead "use finufft_mod")

      integer ier,iflag,ntrans,type,dim
      integer*8 M,N1,N2,N3,Nk
      integer*8 plan,n_modes(3)
      real*8, allocatable :: xj(:),yj(:),zj(:), sk(:),tk(:),uk(:)
      real*8 tol
      complex*16, allocatable :: cj(:), fk(:)
      type(finufft_opts) opts

 !    simple interface
      call finufft1d1(M,xj,cj,iflag,tol,N1,fk,opts,ier)
      call finufft1d2(M,xj,cj,iflag,tol,N1,fk,opts,ier)
      call finufft1d3(M,xj,cj,iflag,tol,Nk,sk,fk,opts,ier)
      call finufft2d1(M,xj,yj,cj,iflag,tol,N1,N2,fk,opts,ier)
      call finufft2d2(M,xj,yj,cj,iflag,tol,N1,N2,fk,opts,ier)
      call finufft2d3(M,xj,yj,cj,iflag,tol,Nk,sk,tk,fk,opts,ier)
      call finufft3d1(M,xj,yj,zj,cj,iflag,tol,N1,N2,N3,fk,opts,ier)
      call finufft3d2(M,xj,yj,zj,cj,iflag,tol,N1,N2,N3,fk,opts,ier)
      call finufft3d3(M,xj,yj,zj,cj,iflag,tol,Nk,sk,tk,uk,fk,opts,ier)

 !    vectorized interface
      call finufft1d1many(ntrans,M,xj,cj,iflag,tol,N1,fk,opts,ier)
      call finufft1d2many(ntrans,M,xj,cj,iflag,tol,N1,fk,opts,ier)
      call finufft1d3many(ntrans,M,xj,cj,iflag,tol,Nk,sk,fk,opts,ier)
      call finufft2d1many(ntrans,M,xj,yj,cj,iflag,tol,N1,N2,fk,opts,ier)
      call finufft2d2many(ntrans,M,xj,yj,cj,iflag,tol,N1,N2,fk,opts,ier)
      call finufft2d3many(ntrans,M,xj,yj,cj,iflag,tol,Nk,sk,tk,fk,opts,ier)
      call finufft3d1many(ntrans,M,xj,yj,zj,cj,iflag,tol,N1,N2,N3,fk,opts,ier)
      call finufft3d2many(ntrans,M,xj,yj,zj,cj,iflag,tol,N1,N2,N3,fk,opts,ier)
      call finufft3d3many(ntrans,M,xj,yj,zj,cj,iflag,tol,Nk,sk,tk,uk,fk,opts,ier)

 !    guru interface
      call finufft_makeplan(type,dim,n_modes,iflag,ntrans,tol,plan,opts,ier)
      call finufft_setpts(plan,M,xj,yj,zj,Nk,sk,yk,uk,ier)
      call finufft_execute(plan,cj,fk,ier)
      call finufft_destroy(plan,ier)

The single-precision (ie, ``real*4`` and ``complex*8``)
functions are identical except with the replacement
of ``finufft`` with ``finufftf`` in each function name.
All are defined (from the C++ side) in ``fortran/finufftfort.cpp``.


Code examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``fortran/examples`` directory contains the following demos,
mostly in both precisions.
Each has a math test to check the correctness of some or all outputs::

  simple1d1.f        - 1D type 1, simple interface, default and various opts
  guru1d1.f          - 1D type 1, guru interface, default and various opts
  nufft1d_demo.f     - 1D types 1,2,3, minimally changed from CMCL demo codes
  nufft2d_demo.f     - 2D "
  nufft3d_demo.f     - 3D "
  nufft2dmany_demo.f - 2D types 1,2,3, vectorized (many strengths) interface
  simple1d1.f90      - modern Fortran90 version of simple1d1 using module

These are the double-precision file names; the single precision have a
suffix ``f`` before the ``.f`` (apart from the f90 which has no single-precision
version).
The last four here are modified from demos in the
`CMCL NUFFT libraries <http://www.cims.nyu.edu/cmcl/nufft/nufft.html>`_.
The first three of these have been changed only to use FINUFFT.
The final tolerance they request is ``tol=1d-16``. For this case FINUFFT
will report a warning that it cannot achieve it, and gets
merely around $10^{-14}$.
The last four demos require direct summation (slow) reference implementations
of the transforms in ``fortran/directft``, modified from their CMCL
counterparts only to remove the $1/M$ prefactor for type 1 transforms.

All demos have self-contained example GCC
compilation/linking commands in their comment headers.
For dynamic linking so that execution works from any directory, bake in an
absolute path via the compile flag ``-Wl,-rpath,$(FINUFFT)/lib``.
