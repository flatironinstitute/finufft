 int finufftf_makeplan(int type, int dim, int64_t* nmodes, int iflag, int ntr, float eps, 
 finufftf_plan* plan, finufftf_opts* opts)
 
   Make a plan to perform one or more general transforms.
 
   Under the hood, for type 1 and 2, this does FFTW planning and kernel Fourier
   transform precomputation. For type 3, this does very little, since the FFT
   sizes are not yet known.
 
 Inputs:
      type   type of transform (1,2, or 3)
      dim    spatial dimension (1,2, or 3)
      nmodes if type is 1 or 2, numbers of Fourier modes (length dim array),
             ie, {N1} in 1D, {N1,N2} in 2D, or {N1,N2,N3} in 3D.
             If type is 3, it is unused.
     iflag  if >=0, uses +i in complex exponential, otherwise -i
     ntr    how many transforms (only for vectorized "many" functions, else ntr=1)
     eps    desired relative precision; smaller is slower. This can be chosen
            from 1e-1 down to ~ 1e-14 (in double precision) or 1e-6 (in single)
     opts   pointer to options struct (see opts.rst), or NULL for defaults
 
   Outputs:
      plan   plan object (under the hood this is a pointer to another struct)
     return value  0: success, 1: success but warning, >1: error (see error.rst)
 
   Notes:
      * All available threads are planned by default (but see opts.nthreads)
      * The vectorized (many vector) plan, ie ntrans>1, can be much faster
        than repeated calls with the same nonuniform points.
        Note that here the I/O data ordering is stacked rather than interleaved.
      * For more details about the fields in the opts pointer, see opts.rst

 int finufft_setpts(finufft_plan plan, int64_t M, double* x, double* y, double* z, int64_t 
 N, double* s, double* t, double* z)
 int finufftf_setpts(finufftf_plan plan, int64_t M, float* x, float* y, float* z, int64_t 
 N, float* s, float* t, float* z)
 
   Input nonuniform points with coordinates x (and possibly y, and possibly z),
   and, if type 3, nonuniform frequency target coordinates s (and possibly t,
   and possibly u), into an existing plan. If type is 1 or 2 then the last four
   arguments are ignored. Unused dimensions are ignored.
 
   Under the hood, for type 1 or 2, this routine bin-sorts the points (storing
   just the permutation rather than new copies of the coordinates). For type
   3 it also bin-sorts the frequencies, chooses two levels of grid sizes, then
   plans the inner type 2 call (interpolation and FFTW).
 
   Inputs:
      M      number of nonuniform spatial points (used by all types)
      x      nonuniform point x-coordinates (length M real array)
      y      if dim>1, nonuniform point y-coordinates (length M real array),
             ignored otherwise
      z      if dim>2, nonuniform point z-coordinates (length M real array),
             ignored otherwise
      N      number of nonuniform frequency targets (type 3 only, ignored
             otherwise)
      s      nonuniform frequency x-coordinates (length N real array)
      t      if dim>1, nonuniform frequency y-coordinates (length N real array),
             ignored otherwise
      u      if dim>2, nonuniform frequency z-coordinates (length N real array),
             ignored otherwise
 
   Input/Outputs:
      plan   plan object
 
   Outputs:
     return value  0: success, 1: success but warning, >1: error (see error.rst)
 
   Notes:
     * The coordinates in x (and if nonempty, y and z) can be any real numbers.
       For type 1 and 2 transforms, their definitions imply that that the
       result is invariant to adding any multiple of 2pi to these coordinates.
       (Internally, each coordinate is folded to [-pi,pi); as usual for
       periodic functions, rounding errors are inevitable if much larger values
       are input.) For type 1 these coordinates are "sources", whereas for type
       2, they are "targets".
       For type 3 the coordinates are "sources", and the "frequency targets"
       s (and if nonempty, t and u) may also be any real numbers; the only
       restriction for type 3 is that the product of source and target domain
       sizes is not too large (it controls the internal fine grid size).
     * The coordinates pointed to by any used arrays x, y, z, s, t, u must
       not be changed between this call and the below execute call!

 int finufft_execute(finufft_plan plan, complex<double>* c, complex<double>* f)
 int finufftf_execute(finufftf_plan plan, complex<float>* c, complex<float>* f)
 
   Perform one or more NUFFT transforms using previously entered nonuniform
   points and an existing plan. To summarize, this maps
     type 1: c -> f
     type 2: f -> c      
     type 3: c -> f
 
   Inputs:
        plan   plan object
 
   Input/Outputs:
        c      For types 1 and 3, the input strengths at the nonuniform point
               sources (size M*ntr complex array).
               If type 2, the output values at the nonuniform point targets
               (size M*ntr complex array).
        f      If type 1, the output Fourier mode coefficients (size N1*ntr or
               N1*N2*ntr or N1*N2*N3*ntr complex array, when dim = 1, 2, or 3
               respectively).
               If type 2, the input Fourier mode coefficients (size N1*ntr or
               N1*N2*ntr or N1*N2*N3*ntr complex array, when dim = 1, 2, or 3
               respectively).
               If type 3, the output values at the nonuniform frequency targets
               (size N*ntr complex array).
               
   Outputs:
     return value  0: success, 1: success but warning, >1: error (see error.rst)
 
   Notes:
     * The contents of the arrays x, y, z, s, t, u must not have changed since
       the finufft_setpts call that read them. The execution rereads them
       (this way of doing business saves RAM).
     * f and c are contiguous Fortran-style arrays with the transform number,
       if ntr>1, being the "slowest" (outer) dimension.
